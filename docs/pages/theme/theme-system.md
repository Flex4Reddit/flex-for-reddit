Flex's theme system allows users to customize colors in the app. Flex also allows customization of Reddit-specific colors such as upvote/downvote colors and moderator/admin colors.

# _On_ Colors

_On_ colors (_On-Primary_, _On-Secondary_, etc.) are typically used when content - such as text & icons - are overlaid on top of another color.


For example, the action bar uses the _Primary_ color for its background. Since the hamburger menu and title is overlaid on top of the background, they are controlled by the _On-Primary_ color.

### Flex Themes

Flex Themes are themes built into Flex by default and cannot be modified. They are the starting point of theme customization.

User Themes are modifiable themes created by the user. They are stored locally on the device. If you use Clear Data on the app, all User Themes will be deleted.
