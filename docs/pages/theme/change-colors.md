Once you're at **My Themes**, click on a **User Theme** to enter the editor and begin customizing. The editor's colors will reflect the theme to give you a preview of the colors.

## Theme Colors

You should see a list of theme colors. Material Design colors are at the top. Reddit colors are at the bottom.

{% assign src="theme_editor.png" | prepend: "/assets/images/" | relative_url %}
[![Color Picker]({{src}}){:.w-50}]({{src}})
{:.text-center}

## Color Picker

Click on an item to bring up the color picker. You can change the color by using the color wheel, or type the ARGB hex code directly.

{% assign src="theme_color_picker.png" | prepend: "/assets/images/" | relative_url %}
[![Color Picker]({{src}}){:.w-50}]({{src}})
{:.text-center}

## Save Before Exiting

Remember to click **Save** before exiting. Otherwise all changes will be lost.
